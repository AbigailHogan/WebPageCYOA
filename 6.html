	<p>The Fairies are very insulted that you've rejected their generous hospitality. You duck and dodge flying bits of fairy food as you run away</p>
	
	<p>You come across a large hole in the ground, you look over the edge and see that it goes down very far into the earth, you cannot see the bottom. Its diameter is dauntingly long across from you but is even longer sideways. Do you take the chance, get a running start and try to jump across the hole or do you take the extra time to walk around. Keep in mind that its beginning to get dark and you're beginning to worry you wont make it home.</p>
