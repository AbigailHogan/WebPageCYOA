	<p>You start to make your way around the hole in the ground. You come upon a large tree on your way. As you get closer to the large tree you hear distant yelling.</p>
	
	<p>You look around and suddenly see a woodland dwarf charging at you, waving his arms and yelling incoherently. You are startled and freeze, this tiny forest man is running inhumanly fast. He comes upon you and with the full force of his weight body checks you. You stumble backward and fall into the hole in the ground.</p>
