	<p>The fairy leads you further into the woods. You come upon an opening in the trees. Thousands of fairies have congregated within this opening. They welcome you into their world. They offer you food and water, you realize you are starving and want to eat but also realize that you still need to make it home. Do you stay and eat with the fairies or keep moving?</p>
