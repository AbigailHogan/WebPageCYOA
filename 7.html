	<p>You get a running start and make the leap. But your feet never make it to the ground on the other side.</p>
	
	<p>You look up and see a woman on a broom, who had grabbed you by the back of your shirt and carried you over the tops of the trees.</p>
	
	<p>You are deathly scared of heights. Do you scream or do you shut your eyes until she lets you down?</p>
