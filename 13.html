	<p>Its getting dark unusually fast. You find a dirt path in the dimming light. The dirt path brings you to a clearing. You walk to the middle of the clearing and immediately fires light up in a circle around you. </p>
	
	<p>Alarmed, you are not sure if you can jump over the fire to get out. Do you panic and freeze or do you risk making a break for it?</p>
